# Finance App
First of all, I'm not a designer, I'm a developer. So, just because  
I don't want to waste my time thinking in UI/UX I just got this  
template on internet and transformed it in a real app using Flutter.

This layout in flutter was created by me but the template in XD was  
created by Mithun Ray that made this template available for free.

Here is the link to his dribble to download the Adobe XD file:

Feel free to make adjustments and send PR's. Let's make this
app more cool.

## Getting Started

Just clone the project and run in a emulator or real device
